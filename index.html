					<h1>Great Tower for London</h1>
					<p>In 1889, inspired by the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, Sir Edward Watkin <i>(a British Member of Parliament and chairman of the Metropolitan Railway)</i> proposed the construction of a taller tower in Wembley Park, London. An architectural competition was held in 1890, and numerous designs were submitted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watkin%27s_Tower">(Wikipedia)</a>. The numbers attached to the designs are consecutive, and simply indicate the order in which they were examined by the Judges, without any reference to their respective merits. <b>Number 37 won</b>.</p>
